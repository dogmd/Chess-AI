# Chess-AI
This is a chess AI and game engine that I have written in java with swing for graphics. I used some resources from the chess programming wiki, and some other chess engines.

To compile and run this yourself, import the repository as an IntelliJ project, or run the jar located [here](out/artifacts/Scott_Chess_jar/Chess-AI.jar).
